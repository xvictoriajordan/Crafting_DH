# Week 1 fail log
So far this week has been interesting. I have not faced many issues thus far, I made all my accounts, signed into the VPN and seem to understand how GitHub works. I am more confused about what the actual work is for week 1, that being said I haven't even gone through the whole unit yet. As for annotations right now, I haven't done any other than the required ones. Hoping to update these once I start the readings.

## First Annotation

## Second Annotation

## Third Annotation
