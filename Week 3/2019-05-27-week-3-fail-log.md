# Week 3 Fail Log

* Couldn't figure out how to get my file from exercise 1 from my DH Box to GitHub using command line (I'll have to review it but as of right now it wasn't happening) so I just downloaded it and uploaded it as a new file.
* After downloading all the file for Ian Milligan's exercise, my brower froze, and then restarted. I did not get a chance to save my history for that part.
