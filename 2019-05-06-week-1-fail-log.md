# Week 1 fail log
Admittedly, I had a difficult first week. I was able to create my GitHub, DH Box, and Hypothesis accounts but there were a few hiccups (that I annotated using Hypothesis).   

## First Annotation
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/kVL5clh7EemcYK_k_itFTg/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was about my confusion setting up the DH Box account. I did not pay attention to the sign-up and accidentally chose the 24 account time frame instead of the month long account. Unfortunately, I only realized this after I couldn't login to my account anymore. I had some files in my DH Box account already which I have since lost.

This exerperience taught me to pay attention to every step of the sign-up process also that I should download my file/work as well as copy a list of my commands (I learned that I can do this by typing ``ls`` into the terminal!)

## Second Annotation
My [second annotation](https://hyp.is/1cuQqlh7Eem3qVOpwa1E0Q/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) kind of connects to my first one. I forgot my password at the end of the week and noticed that DH Box doesn't have a 'forgot password' retrieval option. Thankfully, I had learned from the experience of my first annotation and documented my workflow/downloaded my files I had in the DH Box. 

Perhaps, then, this is a great place to discuss the realities of some open access software. I realized that a feature like password retrieval is standard for many websites because they are actively maintained and you have one account forever. When you use open access software, you can be working in a precarious digital world.

## Third Annotation
My [third annotation](https://hyp.is/P-j0AFh8EemYXn9Z1Pmgww/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was a case of me learning about where I download/install programs and plugins. When I created my Hypothesis account, I downloaded the plugin for Google Chrome. Later, I went onto the course workbook and tried to annotate, but I couldn't find the Hypothesis button. After searching for a while I realized that I was using the Safari browser. I switched back to Chrome and was able to annotate.

This experience taught me about paying attention to where I install software and that these plugins are browser specific. 

## Comments/Concerns

Overall, this week went well. It seemed daunting at first, but I soon realized that everyone makes mistakes, especially when they are learning new skills, using new software, etc. **Making mistakes is part of the process and necessary to learn.**

I am a bit concerned about diving into GitHub next week, but I see there are instruction videos which I imagine will help a lot!
