# Week 2 Fail Log

* Forgot to put .md at the end of my Dillinger document and then spent 20 minutes trying to figure out why it wasn't formatting correctly. *Note to self, don't forget .md!* 
* When imbedding an image into Dillinger I couldn't get the image to appear at first when I pasted the web address from the address bar. I then right clicked and clicked on copy image address and it worked!
* While looking for websites to link to my Dillinger post I found [this open access page](https://library.carleton.ca/services/open-access) on Carleton's Library front page. I will be looking into it futher and I'm not sure if it's new but I've never seen it before.
